This library allows an Arduino board to control liquid crystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs.
Virtual base class for LiquidCrystal libraries, allows you to use one library for LiquidCrystal and LiquidCrystal_I2C displays. Allows you to create general LCD object and use same methods for different derived classes.
