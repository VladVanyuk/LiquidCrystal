= {repository-name} Base Class =

This library allows an Arduino board to control liquid crystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs.
Virtual base class for (LCDs) devices, allows you to use one library for LiquidCrystal displays and LiquidCrystal_I2C displays as objects of child classes.
Allows you to create general LCD object and use same methods for different derived classes.

TIP: To find the latest versions, refer to https://github.com/VladVanyuk/BaseLiquidCrystal[this link].

== Class hierarchy structure:
....
 LiquidCrystal_Base       => Base virtual(abstact) class. Has methods for all derived classes.
  ├── LiquidCrystal       => Implementation of standart Arduino LCD library as derived class
  └── LiquidCrystal_I2C   => Implementation of I2C LCD library as derived class
....
